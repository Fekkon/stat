## Scientific Method  
1. Research question
1. Theory development
1. Hypotheses
1. Design
1. **Analysis**

---

## What makes for an interesting question?  
- Important to journalism/media
- Contribute to scientific understanding/literature  
- Personally interesting  
- Unresolved

---

## Three Types of Research Questions
- Prevalence
- Types/levels
- Changes
- Causal Effects

---

## Research designs
- Surveys
- Experiments
- Content analysis

---


## Measuring constructs
- Conceptual (i.e., definition)
- Indicators (i.e., operationalization) 

---

## Theory Development
- Caveat: Not the focus of this course
- Theories are arguments **and** explanations
- Theories are causal in nature
- Often involve claims about mechanisms
- Rooted in past evidence or observation

---

## From Hypotheses to Design
- Hypothesis: Expectations about outcomes across levels of two or more variables
- Design: Selection and arrangement of evidence
- Design must reveal evidence about our hypotheses
   - Selection of observations/units
   - Observation of outcome(s)
   - Observation of variation on the causal variable
   - Causal identification

---

## Questions?

---

## Course Objectives
- Describe journalism/media relevant research questions and hypotheses
- Evaluate and deduce observable implications from mass media and journalism theories
    - Explain statistical procedures and their appropriate usages
- Apply statistical procedures to relevant research problems
- Synthesize results from statistical analyses into well-written and well-structured essays
- Demonstrate how to use R for statistical analysis

---

## Why R?
- SPSS/SAS/stata all cost money
- R is open source, free, and at cutting edge

---

## Textbooks and Readings
- All required readings can be found online

---

## Exam
- Two take-home exams
- Should take anywhere from 2-5 hours
- More details as they approach

---

## Homework assignments
- Assignments/submissions on Canvas
- All assignments will require use of R

---

## Weekly Activities
- Various in-class activities

---

## Course Outline
- Research design
- Group comparisons
- Correlations and factors
- Linear models
- Advanced models
- Text analysis
- Data science

---
