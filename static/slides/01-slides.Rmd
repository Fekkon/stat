## Quantitative research
Review

---

## Scientific Method  
1. Research question
1. Develop theory and state hypotheses
1. Design study and collect data
1. **Analysis** (this class)

---

## Research questions
- Important to journalism/mass communication
- Contribute to scientific understanding/literature  
- Personally interesting  
- Unresolved or unknown

---

## Research designs
- Survey
- Experiment
- Content analysis

---


## Measuring constructs
- Conceptual (i.e., definition)
- Indicators (i.e., operationalization) 


---

## From Hypotheses to Design
- Hypothesis: Expectations of co-variations between two or more variables
- Design must test hypotheses
   - Unit of analysis
   - Observation of variables of interest
   - Observation of mechanisms/explanatory
   - Observation of other relevant or confounding variables

---

## Course Objectives
- Describe journalism/media relevant research questions and hypotheses
- Evaluate and deduce observable implications from mass media and journalism theories
    - Explain statistical procedures and their appropriate usages
- Apply statistical procedures to relevant research problems
- Synthesize results from statistical analyses into well-written and well-structured essays
- Demonstrate how to use R for statistical analysis

---

## Why R?
- SPSS/SAS/stata all cost money
- R is open source, free, and at cutting edge
- Learning R means learning programming (web scraping, automated work flows, etc.)

---

## Exams
- Two take-home exams
- Each exam should take anywhere from 2-5 hours
- More details as exams get clsoser

---

## Homework assignments
- Assignments/submissions on Canvas
- All assignments will require use of R

---

## Weekly Activities
- Various in-class activities

---

## Course Outline
- Research design
- Group comparisons
- Correlations and factors
- Linear models
- Advanced models
- Text analysis
- Data science

---

## Instructor
- Office: 
    - Lee Hills Hall 314 
    - Thursdays 11-2pm
- Email: kearneymw@missouri.edu
