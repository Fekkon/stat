      <description>R/RStudio     GitHub    R is the statistical programming language we will learn in this class. We will interface with R using Rstudio, a fully featured interactive development environment (IDE). For instructions on how to install R and Rstudio, click here.    GitHub is a web-based version control repository and internet hosting service. We will not be using Github, but it&#39;s a useful site know about and a great place to search for all kinds of source code.</description>
