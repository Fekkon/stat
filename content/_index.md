The primary analytical methods covered in this course include simple group comparisons (i.e., t-tests, chi-square), correlations, factor analysis, and the linear model (i.e., OLS regression and ANOVA). We will also preview several advanced statistical models as well as some useful tools from data science. Students are required to learn and use R, an open source statistical computing environment."
