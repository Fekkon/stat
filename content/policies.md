### Class:

Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. Quantitative analysis is a skill that is best learned by doing, so as much as possible you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class.

### Grading:

Your final grade will be comprised of the following:

{.table .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}
 <span></span>        | <span></span>
----------------------|----------------
Participation         | 10%
Homework              | 25%
Exam 1                | 20%
Exam 2                | 20%
Final project         | 25%

Grades will be distributed using a plus/minus system. Grades are given as is. 
Final point totals will not, under any circumstance, be rounded or adjusted 
relative to any grading threshold.

### Homework:

Beyond the in-class exercises/examples, you will be assigned multiple homework assignments throughout the semester. Most of these assignments will be completed individually. For explicitly-identified team assignments, team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the assignment. You will be asked to evaluate your team members after each teach assignment. Homework assignments may or may not allow working teams. You should not work as a team unless the assignment explicitly authorizes teams. 

Students are expected to download and update the course repository to their local computers.

### Final Project:

Each student in the course is required to complete either an quantitative report or an academic manuscript, the goal of which is to tackle a significant journalism-related problem using analytical methods covered in this class. Additional details on the project will be provided as the course progresses.

### Exams:

There will be a two take-home [or non-timed online] exams that you are expected to complete individually. Each exam will ask you to complete a number of small programming and/or analysis tasks related to the material presented in the class. The exams will be written to take between 2-5 hours. The exact structure and content of the exams will be discussed in more detail before they are assigned.

### Communication:

I'm flexible on group communication interfaces. What's best or easiest for all of you?

### Academic integrity:

Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity. Cheating on exams or plagiarism on homework assignments, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/resources/dcs">Duke Community Standard</a>, and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved.  Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade along with being reported to the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about/ucbhearings">Undergraduate Conduct Board</a>.

### Academic Dishonesty

Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. All members of the academic community must be confident that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. The academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as extremely serious matters. Sanctions for such a breach may include academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to expulsion. When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting, collaboration, or any other form of cheating, consult the course instructor.

### Excused Absences:

Students who miss a class due to a school-related trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should notify me one-week prior (or, in the case of illness, as soon as possible). Note that these excused absences do not excuse you from assigned homework. It is your responsibility to make alternative arrangements to turn in any assignments in a timely fashion.

Those with a personal emergency or bereavement should speak with your director of graduate studies or your academic dean.

### Late / missed work

- Late work policy for homework assignments:
    - late, but within 24 hours of due date/time: -20%
    - any later: no credit
    
- Late work will not be accepted for take home midterms and the final project.

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. If a midterm exam must be missed, absence must be officially excused in advance of the due date, in which case the missing exam score will be imputed using the final exam score. This policy only applies to the midterm.

- You must complete the final project and be in class to present it in order to pass this course.
